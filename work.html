        “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” is a pangram, a phrase that contains every letter in the alphabet. As graphic designers, we see this phrase repeated over and over. It’s used to quickly experiment with a range of typefaces before making the final selection, a design decision that has a major impact on the look and feel of a project.

        We are a multidisciplinary group of designers working across language, image, code, paper, and whatever old and new tools are at our disposal. While the mediums we work with and the tools we use vary, we are united in telling new stories and interrogating what exists in the world through form and typography.

        All great works are built from collaboration—many small units making up a whole. No major production would be possible without a dedicated crew working the lighting, arranging the props, and ensuring actors are where they need to be. As graphic designers, we also must consider the process and moving parts that lead us to the final product. Each and every pixel.
        </p>

        We, the RISD Graphic Design class of 2026, as individual letters, come together to form one alphabet, while still embracing the wild variety in our work.
