    "description": "This book takes readers on a journey through time, guided by scripts from two ancient tombs: Mawangdui in China and the Tomb of Ankhmahor in Egypt. The Mawangdui tombs, dating back to the Han Dynasty, contain philosophical and medical works, including the Dao De Jing, while the Egyptian tomb offers insights into daily life, beliefs, and the afterlife. By juxtaposing these two cultures, the book explores their views on mortality, health, and the cosmos."

Designed to be reshuffled, its pages are filled with fragmented imagery and vulnerable text, reflecting the nature \nof longing. The cover, resembling a hand-drawn envelope, and the handwritten letters throughout reinforce the intimacy of love letters. Scattered within are clear envelopes, blank pages, pressed flowers, and stickers with poetry, which are all interactive details that invite the reader to customize, collage, and make the book their own."

Through the scent of the paper, bilingual storytelling, illustration, packaging, and the tactile texture of each page, it transforms Chinese tea culture into an intimate encounter, one that can be seen, touched, and felt beyond words. Blending design, memory, and heritage, it reflects my personal relationship to Chinese culture, where tea becomes a medium for tracing identity, tradition, and the passage of time."
